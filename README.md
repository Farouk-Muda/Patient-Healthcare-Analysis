## Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of healthcare datasets to identify trends in patient outcomes, hospital performance, and other critical healthcare metrics. The analysis was performed using Microsoft Excel, with a focus on data cleaning, manipulation, visualization, and reporting of insights that can help improve healthcare services.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
- To clean and prepare the healthcare dataset for analysis.
- To analyze patient outcomes and hospital performance using various statistical methods.
- To create interactive visualizations in Excel that provide insights into the data.
- To generate a comprehensive report that highlights key trends, insights, and recommendations for healthcare improvements.

## Dataset
- Source: This is a dummy dataset from kaggle [Healthcare Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasad22/healthcare-dataset) contains information on various healthcare metrics, including patient demographics, treatment outcomes, hospital efficiency, and more.
- Size: It consists of 54,967 rows and 15 columns, each representing a synthetic patient healthcare record.
- Features: The columns are patient name, age, gender, blood type, insurance provider, hospital name, length of stay, admission type, billing amount and other relevant healthcare indicators.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
Data cleaning and preparation were performed to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis:
- Handling Missing Values: Imputed missing values where necessary and removed irrelevant rows/columns.
- Data Normalization: Standardized data formats and units of measurement to ensure consistency.
- Outlier Detection: Identified and treated outliers to prevent skewing the analysis results.
- Data Structuring: Organized the data into a format that is optimal for analysis and visualization.

## Key Findings
Some of the key insights derived from the analysis include:
- Patient Outcomes: Identified the most effective treatment methods for various conditions.
- Hospital Performance: Highlighted the top-performing hospitals based on treatment success rates and patient satisfaction.
- Demographic Trends: Uncovered trends in patient outcomes based on age, gender, and other demographics.
- Resource Utilization: Provided insights into how hospitals can optimize their resources for better patient care.

## Tools and Technologies
- Microsoft Excel: Primary tool used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
- Excel Features: Utilized pivot tables, conditional formatting, VLOOKUP, and other advanced Excel functions.
- Data Visualization: Created charts and graphs using Excel's built-in charting tools
